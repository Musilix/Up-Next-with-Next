# Up Next with Next
I wanted to test out the use cases of Next, so I figured I could build a small little app with Fastify, React, Postgres, and Node (FRPN ) while utilizing the React framework, Next.

A use case demo of Next.js, propped up on my super sexy tech stack, FRPN (Fastify, React, Postgres, Node). For the connoisseurs out there, we call that stack the Frippin Stack.

This app is for those out there that want a bit more flavor and spunk in their life. Aren't you tired of living your life in a cube? Still having those fragmented thoughts pass through your mind as you sit in your gray death matrix?
